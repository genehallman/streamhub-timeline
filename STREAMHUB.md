# streamhub-timeline

Show a high-level visualization of the frequency of Content posted in a StreamHub Collection. This is great as a navigation element that lets users jump to a specific point in a [streamhub-ticker](http://apps.livefyre.com/packages/genehallman/streamhub-ticker/master/overview) or LiveBlog.

## Features

* Display a timeline of Content posted into a StreamHub Collection
* Customize Content that should be 'highlighted' as a notable piece of Content, big play, or other important announcement
* Configure click handlers to fire when a user clicks on an item on the timeline

## See it in Action

streamhub-timeline was created to navigate live, play-by-play coverage for [Livefyre's SocialHub during the 2013 Super Bowl](http://superbowl.livefyre.com).

Immediately below the header, streamhub-timeline shows a dot for each play, with featured plays like touchdowns showing as a special, larger marker. Users can hover over any play to see more information, and click to navigate the Gametracker to that point in time and view fan reactions.

## Usage

streamhub-timeline is an embeddable JavaScript application that runs in any HTML5-compatible browser, including mobile devices and tablets. The included Developer Documentation explains the API to instantiate a streamhub-timeline and stream in Content from a StreamHub Collection.

StreamHub Apps require a [Livefyre StreamHub](http://www.livefyre.com/streamhub/) subscription to power Curation, Collection, Content storage, and real-time syndication. To inquire about subscribing to StreamHub, [contact](http://www.livefyre.com/contact/) Livefyre.
